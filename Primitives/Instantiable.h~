// Instantiable.h

// The Instantiable class is for anything that can be instantiated in multiples. It is not meant for any 
// important resource controllers, though it does include the player (which will tend to only exist alone). The
// general rule of thumb is that if its data is not CRITICAL, and it is safe to be destroyed, then it can be of
// type Instantiable. In fact, anything destructible SHOULD be of type Instantiable.
